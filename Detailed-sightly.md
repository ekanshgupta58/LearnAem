# AEM Sightly (HTL) Detailed Documentation

## What is AEM Sightly (HTL)?

**AEM Sightly**, now known as **HTL (HTML Template Language)**, is a templating language used in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) for developing component-specific HTML. It is designed to replace JSP (JavaServer Pages) and provide a more secure and maintainable way to write server-side HTML.

## Key Features of HTL

1. **Separation of Concerns**: It ensures a clear separation between the logic and the presentation layers.
2. **Readability and Maintainability**: The syntax is designed to be easy to read and understand, even for those who are not experienced developers.
3. **Secure by Default**: It minimizes the risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by escaping HTML output by default.
4. **Component-based Development**: Encourages reusable and modular design, aligning with AEMâ€™s component-based architecture.

## Basic Syntax

HTL uses special attributes and expressions within HTML tags to inject dynamic content and logic. Here are some basics:

### Expressions

Insert dynamic data using `${}` syntax.
```html
<div>${message}</div>
```

### Context-Aware Escaping

By default, HTL escapes output to prevent XSS. For example:
```html
<div>${userInput}</div>
```
Here, `userInput` will be automatically escaped to prevent potential XSS attacks.

### Use API

Allows calling Java code and accessing Sling models.
```html
<sly data-sly-use.myComponent="com.example.MyComponent">
  <div>${myComponent.title}</div>
</sly>
```

### Components of HTL

#### Variables

Define variables within the template using `data-sly-use`.
```html
<sly data-sly-use.myVar="42">
  <div>${myVar}</div>
</sly>
```

#### Conditions

Use `data-sly-test` for conditional rendering.
```html
<div data-sly-test="${condition}">This is conditionally rendered</div>
```

#### Looping

Use `data-sly-list` to iterate over collections.
```html
<ul data-sly-list="${items}">
  <li>${item}</li>
</ul>
```

#### Templates

Reusable chunks of HTML that can be invoked multiple times.
```html
<sly data-sly-template.example="${ @ param1, param2 }">
  <div>${param1} - ${param2}</div>
</sly>
```

## Detailed Examples and Use Cases

### Using Sling Models

Sling Models can be integrated with HTL to provide dynamic content.

**Java Code (Sling Model):**
```java
@Model(adaptables = Resource.class)
public class MyModel {
  @Inject
  private String title;

  public String getTitle() {
    return title;
  }
}
```

**HTL Code:**
```html
<sly data-sly-use.model="com.example.MyModel">
  <div>${model.title}</div>
</sly>
```

### Using Global Objects

HTL provides several global objects that can be used within the templates.

#### `properties`
Represents the properties of the current resource.
```html
<div>${properties.title}</div>
```

#### `currentPage`
Provides information about the current page.
```html
<div>${currentPage.title}</div>
```

#### `resource`
Represents the current resource.
```html
<div>${resource.path}</div>
```

#### `sly`
Allows for template logic without generating output.
```html
<sly data-sly-use.var="com.example.MyModel">
  <!-- logic here -->
</sly>
```

### Handling Attributes Dynamically

HTL allows you to handle attributes dynamically.
```html
<a href="${link.url}" target="${link.target}">${link.text}</a>
```

### Custom HTL Functions

You can create custom HTL functions to extend the language.

**Java Code:**
```java
public class CustomFunctions {
  public static String toUpperCase(String input) {
    return input.toUpperCase();
  }
}
```

**HTL Code:**
```html
<sly data-sly-use.custom="com.example.CustomFunctions">
  <div>${custom.toUpperCase('hello')}</div>
</sly>
```
